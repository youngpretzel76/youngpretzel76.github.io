    <h1>Biology of the Brain</h1>
    <h2>The Lobes</h2>

    <p>In our brains, we have things called lobes. Lobes are projections of a specific part of an organ, in this case, the lobes of the brain. The brain has a total of 4 lobes for each hemisphere, which we'll dive into further down.</p>
    <p>First, the frontal lobe, highlighted in red. The frontal lobe is at the very front of your head. The frontal lobe's function is to focus on decision-making, problem solving, and various other tasks that require some degree of logicality.</p>
    <p>Then, we have the parietal lobe, highlighted in blue. The parietal lobe's function is to detect sensory perception, aka our 5 senses, as well as understanding language, render our spatial surroundings, and more.</p>
    <p>After that, we have the temporal lobe, highlighted in green. The temporal lobe's function is to process auditory information, helps with memory and emotional processing, and more.</p>
    <p>Finally, we have the occipital lobe, highlighted in yellow. The occipital lobe's function is to process visual information, help out with spatial awareness, and more when it comes to our sight!</p>
    <p>Overall, each lobe is different, but most, if not all lobes have some of the same functions, like processing and aiding in memory protection and formation!</p>

    <h2>The Hemispheres</h2>

    alt="A picture showing brain lateralization within the 2 hemispheres.">
    <p>Continuing on, alongside the lobes of the brain, we have 2 hemisphere: the left and the right. Both hemispheres are attributed to different tasks, which is also known as lateralization! Nonetheless, they work together via communication, thanks to the corpus callosum, to make the brain whole.</p>
    <p>The left hemisphere is known to deal with tasks that are rooted in logic, such as problem solving, meticulous planning, and more.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the right hemisphere is known to be more creative! It handles creativity, emotional thought, imagination, and more!</p>
    <p>As stated before, both hemispheres have 4 lobes each, thus totaling out to 8 lobes altogether in the brain.</p>
   
    <h2>The Corpus Callosum</h2>

    style="width:350px;height:400px;"
    alt="A diagram of the corpus callosum.">
    <p>Now, in order for the 2 hemispheres to communicate efficiently, a bundle of nerves connects them, which is called the corpus callosum!</p>
    <p>In some cases, the corpus callosum is needed to be surgically cut to reduce the effects of disorders, such as severe epilepsy. The corpus callosum can be either partially cut or fully severed. Either way, the surgery of the severing of the corpus callosum, also known as a corpus callostomy affects the way the hemispheres communicate with each other.</p>
    <p>These patients who undergo a corpus callostomy are then referred to as split brain patients because the corpus callosum, the sole thing that connects the hemispheres is severed, resulting in what can be assumed to be 2 separate brains.</p>
    <p class="disclaimer"><font size="-1">FYI: There are way more features of the brain, including the cerebellum, the brain stem, and connecting systems like the nervous system, but there's a ton of information to go over, so I won't be discussing it here.</font></p>
