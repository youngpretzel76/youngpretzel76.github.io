    <h1>Brain Scans</h1>
    <h2>CAT/CT Scan</h2>

    alt="A picture of a CAT/CT scan.">

    <p>A CAT/CT scan, also known as a Computerized Axial Tomography scan is a type of brain scan that is great when it comes to scanning bones.</p>
    <p>You can definitely see other structures in the scan itself, but it specifically highlights and is used to check on bone structure, like the skull.</p>
    <p>The CT scan shown above is a healthy patient, however, a CT scan that has negative result can be shown below.</p>

    <p>Abnormal masses (tumors) can be seen on the 6 scans above.</p>

    <h2>MRI scan</h2>

    alt="A picture of an MRI scan.">

    <p>An MRI scan, also known as a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan is a type of brain scan which works best to view soft tissue.</p>
    <p>Again, like a CT scan, you can see other structures, but this is mostly used to view soft tissue.</p>
    <p>The MRI above is healthy. The unhealthy MRI is below.</p>

    style="width:700px;height:400px;"
    alt="A picture of an unhealthy MRI scan.">

    <p>You can see that there are also abnormal masses in the soft tissue. Remember that soft tissue contains both grey and white matter. The lighter the colour, it's white matter. The darker, it's grey matter.</p>

    <h2>EEG Scan</h2>

    alt="A picture of an EEG scan.">

    <p>An EEG, also known as an Electroencephalogram scan is a type of brain scan that records the brain waves. This is the start of brain scan that pertain more to function rather than structure.</p>
    <p>Unlike the previous 2 scans we've covered, an EEG scan the brain waves, some during sleep and some not during sleep. This scan is primarily for those who suffer with epilepsy and seizures.</p>
    <p>A good EEG is shown above. One that shows epileptic activty is below.</p>

    style="width:800px;height:400px;"
    alt="An EEG with circled seizure activty.">

    <p>The circled brain waves look erratic, right? That's because the patient is undergoing a seizure, whether medically induced or not.</p>
